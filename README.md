# provider-template

`provider-template` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that is meant to be used as a template for implementing new Providers. It comes
with the following features that are meant to be refactored:

- A `ProviderConfig` type that only points to a credentials `Secret`.
- A `MyType` resource type that serves as an example managed resource.
- A managed resource controller that reconciles `MyType` objects and simply
  prints their configuration in its `Observe` method.

## Developing

1. Use this repository as a template to create a new one.
1. Find-and-replace `provider-template` with your provider's name.
1. Run `make` to initialize the "build" Make submodule we use for CI/CD.
1. Run `make reviewable` to run code generation, linters, and tests.
1. Replace `MyType` with your own managed resource implementation(s).
